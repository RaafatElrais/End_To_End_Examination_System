# ⚡ End-to-End Examination System

---

### 📘 Project Overview

This project represents a **comprehensive digital examination management system** developed as a **graduation project** by a team of **five members**, led and coordinated by **myself (Team Leader)**.  
We designed and built the entire solution **from scratch**, following an **Agile methodology** and managing progress through **Trello** boards for sprint planning, task tracking, and team collaboration.

The goal was to **digitize the full examination lifecycle** — from student registration and question creation to online test delivery, automated grading, and analytics — integrating **SQL Server, Python (Streamlit), SSRS, Power BI, and Power Apps** into one unified, data-driven platform.

---

### 🎯 Business Problem & Objective

The institution’s manual examination process was time-consuming, error-prone, and lacked real-time performance visibility.

Our objectives were to:
- Build a fully automated, digital examination platform aligned with academic business processes.
- Centralize all student, course, and exam data with structured, secure storage.
- Enable online testing, instant scoring, and dynamic result reporting.
- Deliver high-level business intelligence dashboards for academic decision-making.

---

### 🧩 Agile Process & Team Collaboration

The project was managed using **Agile principles**, divided into **weekly sprints** with continuous iteration and review cycles.  
We used **Trello** for project management — assigning tasks, tracking deadlines, and monitoring progress across development, testing, and documentation phases.

As the **Team Leader**, my responsibilities included:
- Setting sprint goals and distributing development tasks among the five team members.  
- Overseeing integration between the database, Streamlit app, and reporting components.  
- Conducting weekly sprint reviews and retrospectives to ensure delivery milestones.  
- Ensuring technical alignment, testing coordination, and version control using GitHub.

### 🏗️ System Development from Scratch

The system was developed **entirely from zero**, based on the institution’s business logic and operational needs.

Key steps:
- Designed a **custom SQL Server database schema** and **ER Diagram** for storing students, courses, exams, and results.  
- Built **stored procedures** for registration, grading, question randomization, and performance reports.  
- Inserted all business data manually to simulate real institutional operations.  
- Developed a **Streamlit web application in Python** for conducting exams online with **real-time scoring** and **automatic database storage**.  
- Integrated **Power Apps** for a live exam interface and administrative management.  
- Designed **SSRS reports** and **Power BI dashboards** to visualize key performance indicators such as pass rates, question difficulty, and subject averages.
