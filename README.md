# ⚡ End-to-End Examination System

---

### 📘 Project Overview

This project represents a **comprehensive digital examination management system** developed as a **graduation project** by a team of **five members** — designed and built **entirely from scratch** based on the real business model of an educational institution.

The goal was to **digitize the full examination lifecycle** — from student registration and question creation to online test delivery, automated grading, and performance analytics — integrating **SQL Server, Python (Streamlit), SSRS, Power BI, and Power Apps** into one unified, data-driven platform.

---

### 🎯 Business Problem & Objective

The institution’s manual examination process was time-consuming, error-prone, and lacked data visibility.

Our objective was to:
- Build a fully automated, digital examination platform aligned with the institution’s business rules.
- Centralize student, course, and exam data to ensure integrity and traceability.
- Deliver instant scoring, analytics, and visual reports for academic decision-making.
- Create a system that could be **scalable, maintainable, and business-oriented**.

### 🏗️ System Development from Scratch

Based on the business requirements, we developed the system **completely from zero**, generating every layer manually — from database to dashboards.

Key steps:
- Designed a **custom SQL Server database schema** and ER Diagram to store all entities (students, courses, exams, results).
- Built **stored procedures** for registration, question generation, grading, and performance reports.
- Inserted all institutional data manually (student records, questions, results) to mirror real operations.
- Created a **Streamlit web application in Python**, allowing students and administrators to conduct exams online with **real-time scoring** and **automatic result storage** directly in the database.
- Integrated **Power Apps** to provide a live exam screen and administrative control interface.
- Designed **SSRS reports** and **Power BI dashboards** to visualize academic KPIs such as pass rates, subject difficulty, and average scores.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Team Collaboration

This project was developed collaboratively by **five team members**, each handling a specialized part of the system.

**My Role:**
- Designed and implemented the **Streamlit web application** using Python.
- Developed **stored procedures** and handled **database-to-app connectivity**.
- Built and published **Power BI dashboards** for performance monitoring and analytics.
- Managed **data modeling and ETL** processes for clean, accurate analysis.

Other teammates contributed to:
- SQL schema design and optimization.
- SSRS reporting setup.
- Power Apps and Power BI interface development.
- Full documentation and testing.

> 💡 While the system was a team effort, the **Streamlit web interface**, **Python integration**, and **Power BI dashboards** were entirely developed and managed by me.
